                    Hi there! My name is Serhat and welcome to my learning journal

                    After several months of learning, I finally decided to start my journey
                    as a frontend developer.I am excited to learn more and share my knowledge
                    with others. I hope you enjoy my blog posts and find them helpful.

            <p class="section-header">How I stay committed to learning</p>
            <p>
                I like to think of myself as as lifelong learner. I used to spend
                hours and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using
                what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what 
                I was learning and most things about my journmey with the world.
            </p>
            <p class="section-header">How I got started</p>
            <p>
                I started simple gradually grew my learning journal site. 
                I would take ntoes about what I was learning. After each learning session,
                I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also 
                write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.
            </p>
            <p>
                That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting 
                my learning summaries was also helping others and stay motivated.
